# ObFab
A repository of prefabs for Oblige.

## Instructions

* For Oblige 7.59 (Glaice's Edit) version, unzip the folder right into your Oblige root directory.
* For Oblige version 7.70, unzip the themes.lua file from the archive's `/games/doom/' folder into the same directory in Oblige, then extract all contents of the archive's `/prefabs/` into Oblige's `/games/doom/fabs/` folder.
* The prefab pack is highly unlikely to work for any non 7.x version of Oblige.
